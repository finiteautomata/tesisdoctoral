We propose Universal Language Model Fine-tuning (ULMFiT), an effective transfer learning method that can be applied to any task in NLP, and introduce techniques that are key for fine-tuning a language model. Our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art on six text classification tasks, reducing the error by 18-24{\%} on the majority of datasets. Furthermore, with only 100 labeled examples, it matches the performance of training from scratch on 100 times more data. We open-source our pretrained models and code.",

We release SciBERT, a pretrained language model based on BERT (Devlin et. al., 2018) to address the lack of high-quality, large-scale labeled scientific data. SciBERT leverages unsupervised pretraining on a large multi-domain corpus of scientific publications to improve performance on downstream scientific NLP tasks. We evaluate on a suite of tasks including sequence tagging, sentence classification and dependency parsing, with datasets from a variety of scientific domains. We demonstrate statistically significant improvements over BERT and achieve new state-of-the-art results on several of these tasks. The code and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/allenai/scibert/.",

In light of the success of these broad-coverage models, we investigate whether it is still helpful to tailor a pretrained model to the domain of a target task. We present a study across four domains (biomedical and computer science publications, news, and reviews) and eight classification tasks, showing that a second phase of pretraining in-domain (domain-adaptive pretraining) leads to performance gains, under both high- and low-resource settings. Moreover, adapting to the task{'}s unlabeled data (task-adaptive pretraining) improves performance even after domain-adaptive pretraining. Finally, we show that adapting to a task corpus augmented using simple data selection strategies is an effective alternative, especially when resources for domain-adaptive pretraining might be unavailable. Overall, we consistently find that multi-phase adaptive pretraining offers large gains in task performance.",

In this paper, we provide an annotated corpus of hate speech with context information well kept. Then we propose two types of hate speech detection models that incorporate context information, a logistic regression model with context features and a neural network model with learning components for context. Our evaluation shows that both models outperform a strong baseline by around 3{\%} to 4{\%} in F1 score and combining these two models further improve the performance by another 7{\%} in F1 score.",

abstract = {Deep Learning has shown remarkable success during the last decade for essential tasks
in computer vision and natural language processing. Yet, challenges remain in the
development and deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) models in real-world cases,
such as dependence on extensive data and trust, explainability, traceability, and
interactivity. These challenges are amplified in high-risk fields, including healthcare,
cyber threats, crisis response, autonomous driving, and future manufacturing. On the
other hand, symbolic computing with knowledge graphs has shown significant growth
in specific tasks with reliable performance. This tutorial (a) discusses the novel
paradigm of knowledge-infused deep learning to synthesize neural computing with symbolic
computing (b) describes different forms of knowledge and infusion methods in deep
learning, and (c) discusses application-specific evaluation methods to assure explainability
and reasoning using benchmark datasets and knowledge-resources. The resulting paradigm
of "knowledge-infused learning'' combines knowledge from both domain expertise and
physical models. A wide variety of techniques involving shallow, semi-deep, and deep
infusion will be discussed along with the corresponding intuitions, limitations, use
cases, and applications. More details can be found urlhttp://kidl2020.aiisc.ai/.},
